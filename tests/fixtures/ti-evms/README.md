# TI EVM Circuit JSON fixtures

These fixtures contain the PCB and primary electrical schematic converted from
Texas Instruments' published Altium design files. They were generated with
`tscircuit/altium-to-circuit-json` at commit
`9a578b5762e1dcca06e6d3f84f1d2950d0acc301`.

The upstream files and checksums are maintained in that repository's
`scripts/references/reference-manifest.ts`. The gzip files only avoid committing
several megabytes of repetitive JSON; tests expand them before conversion.
